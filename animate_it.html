                        <p>I followed Ryan King Art's tutorial series on how to make a Sci-Fi Worker robot, which then led me to making my own animation. These are the videos that jump started it all.</p><br>
                        <p>I first found Ryan in January as he was uploading his tutorial series on how to animate a Sci-Fi Worker Robot. He was the perfect teacher and motivated me to branch off from his tutorial to make my own animation. That was how The Cube was created.</p><br>
                        <p>Build A Robot is all about helping others learn how to make their own creations using Ryan King Art's series. However, if you'd like to do more than just make a robot, keep watching! Here, you'll learn how to bring your creation to life!</p>

                    <h3 class="parts">Part 1</h3>
                    <p>Once you have built your robot along with texturing it, this is where the animation process begins. The first step of this process is limiting which way each part rotates.</p><br>
                    <h3 class="parts">Part 2</h3>
                    <p>This is where things become a little more conceptual. In this part, a scene must be created and your robot must be lit. A virtual camera will then be angled to take a picture of the robot you created. Make sure to give it a nice pose!</p><br>
                    <h3 class="parts">Part 3</h3>
                    <p>You've done it. The world has now gained a fully realized animation. After creating your environment, you've animated your robot as if it were truly alive. Congratulations! You have built a robot and animated it, too!</p><br>
