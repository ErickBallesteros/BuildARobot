                            <p>The Cube is an animated short made by me, Erick Ballesteros. Using the help of the YouTuber Ryan King Art, I was able to create and animate a small robot roaming the halls of some vague sci-fi structure.</p>

                            <p>Ryan King Art is a YouTuber who makes tutorials online. He primarily focuses on Blender, a 3D software used to make 3D models and animations. The robot used in my Animation was by his design.</p>

                            <p>I first found Ryan in January as he was uploading his tutorial series on how to animate a Sci-Fi Worker Robot. He was the perfect teacher and motivated me to branch off from his tutorial to make my own animation. That was how The Cube was created.</p>
